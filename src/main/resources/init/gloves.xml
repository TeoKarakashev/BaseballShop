        <description>In addition, it features the same superior comfort and feel you expect from any HOH glove thanks to
            its deer-tanned palm lining, thermoformed wrist lining, and padded thumb sleeve. This infield glove's
            200-pattern is our most popular infield pattern, due to its large pocket and extreme versatility. All of
            this comes together beautifully, in an eye-catching three-tone camel, navy, and Columbia blue design to make
            you standout every play. As a result, you'll get an eye-catching glove that is only outdone by the amazing
            plays you'll make with it.

            fit - allowing for more comfort and control in the field.
